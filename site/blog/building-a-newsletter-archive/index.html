      <h1>Building a newsletter archive</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <a href="https://bullish.email">Bullish</a> is a stock market newsletter that I built to keep me informed
        about the market ups and downs and help with my investments.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the features on my radar was an archiving functionality to help
        with long-tail SEO and showcase previous editions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final code turned out to be pretty small, but it took a few trial
        and errors to get to the solution I'll detail below.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bullish is nowadays referred to as
        <a href="https://jamstack.wtf">JAMstack</a>, meaning its a static
        website, no backend, just plain old HTML and Javascript. It's a cool new
        way to build modern products without worrying about infrastructure
        beforehand.
      </p>

      <p>
        To build an Archive, first and foremost, we need to decide where to
        store content, in this case, each email sent, and the obvious solution
        is S3. You can overengineer whatever you like, but nothing will beat S3
        for simple file storage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next challenge was to figure out how to route requests coming from
        <a href="https://bullish.email/archive"
          >https://bullish.email/archive</a
        >
        to S3 but keep the URL’s with clean names like
        <a
          href="https://bullish.email/archive/2020-10/nasdaq-lost-1-57-today.html"
          >https://bullish.email/archive/2020-10/nasdaq-lost-1-57-today.html</a
        >and for that, what you need is a reverse proxy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bullish’s website runs on
        <a href="https://www.netlify.com">https://www.netlify.com</a>, and they
        have an
        <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/"
          >elegant solution</a
        >
        to solve this baked into their product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Netlify supports
        <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/"
          >proxy redirects</a
        >, and that’s what I needed. All I had to do was specify a
        <a
          href="https://github.com/eduardosasso/bullish/blob/master/netlify.toml"
          >netlify.toml</a
        >
        with the rules, and everything pretty much worked on the first try.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the biggest two problems solved, I focused on wiring the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/eduardosasso/bullish/blob/master/services/archive.rb"
          >code</a
        >
        to upload to S3 after each email edition goes out and a rake task to
        update the archive every day triggered via
        <a
          href="https://github.com/eduardosasso/bullish/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml#L12"
          >Github actions as a scheduled event</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://github.com/eduardosasso/bullish/blob/master/Rakefile#L87"
          >rake task</a
        >
        to update the archive index works by looping through all files in S3 for
        the current month and feeds that into an
        <a
          href="https://github.com/eduardosasso/bullish/blob/master/templates/html/archive.html"
          >HTML template</a
        >that uses the
        <a href="http://mustache.github.io">Mustache template engine</a> to spit
        out a static index.html file that is uploaded back to S3 to become
        <a href="https://bullish.email/archive">https://bullish.email/archive</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside S3, the archive bucket has the following folder structure labeled
        in the format year-month like <b>2020-10</b>, <b>2020-09</b>, where all
        the emails go plus an index.html file with a list of all the files in
        each particular folder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another index.html sits in the root of the bucket, which is essentially
        a copy of the index file from the current month's folder, and that
        becomes the entry point for
        <a href="https://bullish.email/archive">/archive</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the rake task to update the archive index, we also update the
        directory, which recycles the past month's folder, let's say
        <b>2020-09</b> to be under
        <a href="https://bullish.email/archive/directory">/archive/directory</a
        >. So <a href="https://bullish.email/archive">/archive</a> points to the
        current month’s index while
        <a href="https://bullish.email/archive/directory">/archive/directory</a>
        has a list of all previous months like
        <a href="https://bullish.email/archive/2020-09/">/archive/2020-09</a>
        and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another neat thing I did was to inject a popup snippet in the email file
        before it gets uploaded to S3. If somebody happens to land on an archive
        URL from a previous edition, they'll get an upsell to subscribe to
        Bullish in there.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this concludes the last big-ticket item from the initial feature set
        I had planned in the back of my head when I started this project.
      </p>

      <p>Now it's time to chill, regroup and decide what's next.</p>

      <p>Cheers.</p>
